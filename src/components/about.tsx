                    The 2000 - 2006 Honda Insight covers the first generation of Honda's first hybrid car to hit the market.

                    This vehicle boasts ~60 MPG and still beats most of the other hybrid cars out there today.

                    I started this webpage for Honda Insight enthusiasts who want to find their own vehicle.
